<h2>
Learn Katakana by reading real words!
</h2>
<p>
The content is based on the titles of articles in the Japanese Wikipedia and their linked English "equivalents". (Sometimes they aren't actually transliterations at all, another problem!)
</p>
<p>
Here's how this site works:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You progress through "levels" consisting of lists of words written in Katakana.</li>
<li>At each level, a new Katakana "letter" (syllable, really, but whatever) is introduced.</li>
<li>All words from the (huge) wordlist which can be spelled using only that letter and letters from previous lessons are listed. For example, at level </li>
<li>The words link to a Japanese article on Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because it's automatically generated, right now there are some rather weird words in here (for instance, Japanese transliterations of the names of ancient Egyptian gods, small towns in Botswana, etc etc). I'm going to have to figure out some way to weed out the words that would probably be meaningless to the learner even if they were written in the Roman script in the first place.</p>

<p>Still, the levels are "programmatic" in the sense that each level contains only the letters that have been seen before, plus one additional letter. So for someone trying to improve their command of Katakana it might be a fun thing to try to see how many of the words are sensible.</p> 
<p>Needless to say this is a work in progress, but if you want to click around, try <a href=levels/04.html>starting here</a>.
