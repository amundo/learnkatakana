<p>
This site is supposed to help you learn Katakana by reading real words.
</p>
<p>
The content is based on the titles of articles in the Japanese Wikipedia that are only in English.
</p>
<p>
Because it's automatically generated, right now there are some random words in here. It's "programmatic" in the sense that each level contains only the letters that have been seen before, plus one additional letter. (The letters are added in terms of frequency.) Needless to say this is a work in progress, but if you want to click around, try <a href=levels/04.html>starting here</a>.
