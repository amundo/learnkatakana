  <h1>How should I approach learning the Katakana?</h1> 
  
  <div id=narration>
  
  <p>Heck, I dunno!</p>

  <p>But here are the principles behind this site:</p>

  <dl>
  <dt>Read meaningful words.</dt>
  <dd>It seems that there's something about "discovering" what a word means that makes it stick. If you're just reading out random syllables there is no such effect.</dd>

  <dt>Learn frequent characters first.</dt>
  <dd>You'll learn the most common characters first. As you progress through the list of characters, the number of words you can decipher goes up fast. Once you've learned 10 characters or so there'll be scads of words you can read.</dd>

  <dt>Have fun.</dt>
  <dd>You can't download the whole list into your brain at once. Take breaks. And give yourself a little credit: stop to appreciate what you've already learned.</dd>
