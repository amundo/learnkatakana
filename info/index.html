    <p>
    Katakana is a <strong>syllabary</strong>. Each "letter" actually represents a syllable. For instance:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li><strong>カ</strong> ka</li>
    <li><strong>タ</strong> ta</li>
    <li><strong>カ</strong> ka</li>
    <li><strong>ナ</strong> na</li>
    </ul>

    <p>カタカナ</p>

    <p>Katakana is fun to learn, because it is used mainly to write loanwords into Japanese. These days, the vast majority of loanwords into Japanese are from English.</p> 
    <p>So, with a little practice you can memorize the Katakana symbols, and then you can play the fun games of trying to find and decipher English loanwords stashed in Japanese text.</p> 
    <p>You'll be surprised just how common Katakana words are. Even if you don't know how to speak Japanese at all, you'll be able to decipher some words.</p> 
    <p>This site is here to help you do the memorizing, and to practice deciphering.</p>
